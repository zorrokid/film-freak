# film_freak

film_freak is WIP name for my collection management app which is mostly focusing on managing a movie collection but might support other types of media in future (games, music, books, comics etc).

It's implemented with Flutter SDK using Dart programming language. This is my first serious attempt with Flutter and I must say I'm quite impressed with it. I really enjoy developing with Flutter and Dart.

Currently data is saved to a local SQLite database but I'm planning implementing a data synchronization with a cloud database (at that phase user accounts will be supported as well).

One of the features I've been focusing from the start is using Goole ML Kit to recognize text from images and implementing a widget to fill textual form fields by selecting text from a image.

Collection items can be searched and added by scanning a barcode.
