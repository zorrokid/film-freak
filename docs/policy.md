## App permissions

### Camera

This application requires permission for camera so that you can add photos of the releases added to collection. The photos are also used if you want to pick text directly from image to fill in fields in release form (e.g. name of the release or other information). 

### Internet

The internet permission is used currently to do search queries to TMDB (The movie Database).
